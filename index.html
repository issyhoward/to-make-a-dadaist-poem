    <h1>To Make a Dadaist Poem</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Take a newspaper.</li>
      <li>Take a pair of scissors.</li>
      <li>Choose an article as long as you are planning to make your poem.</li>
      <li>Cut out the article.</li>
      <li>
        Then cut out each of the words that make up this article and put them in
        a bag.
      </li>
      <li>Shake it gently.</li>
      <li>
        Then take out the scraps one after the other in the order in which they
        left the bag.
      </li>
      <li>Copy conscientiously.</li>
      <li>The poem will be like you.</li>
      <li>
        And here are you a writer, infinitely original and endowed with a
        sensibility that is charming though beyond the understanding of the
        vulgar.
      </li>

      const article = When I first read Natalia Ginzburg’s work several years ago, I felt as if I was reading something that had been written for me, something that had been written almost inside my own head or heart. I was astonished that I had never encountered Ginzburg’s work before: that no one, knowing me, had ever told me about her books. It was as if her writing was a very important secret that I had been waiting all my life to discover. Far more than anything I myself had ever written or even tried to write, her words seemed to express something completely true about my experience of living, and about life itself. This kind of transformative encounter with a book is, for me, very rare, a moment of contact with what seems to be the essence of human existence. For this reason, I wanted to write a little about Natalia Ginzburg and her novel All Our Yesterdays. I would like to address myself in particular to other readers who are right now awaiting, whether they know it or not, their first and special meeting with her work.
